Massive CSI catch up after Molly and Nick's wedding

- read ch 6.1 - 6.3 [X]
- go through Anki cards [X]
- do pre-work for memory hierarchy 1 []
- watch recording of class from Friday 
- read the rest of Ch 6 
- try and do the pre-work 

I think since this is a follow up class from last time I should probably just work through things in that order so that I'm building up instead of swiss cheesing. 

Memory hierarchy 1 prework: 

- installed multipass and valgrind / cachegrind 

* Which function takes longer to run, if any?

option 1 is much faster, 0.03 seconds vs 0.25 seconds for option 2.

* Do they execute the same number of instructions?

very close to the same number of instructions

* What do you notice about the cache utilization of each program?_How much_better is one than the other? Does this match your expectations?

option 2 takes longer, d2 cache miss rate is 14% compared to 1% for option 1. This wouldn't match my expectations unless I'd read about locality in Ch6. 

* As a stretch goal, try to do a first principles analysis of the expected performance of both functions, considering your specific hardware. How close was the cachegrind simulation?
