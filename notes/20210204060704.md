Going to start taking daily notes just so I have a dumping ground for thoughts as I'm moving through the program. Found the sync up last night really motivating mostly due to how many moments I found myself scratching my head.. 

- not knowing off the top of my head how much memory is allocated by the compiler when a simple data type is declared
- stack and heap memory, stack frames..
- dangling pointers
- CPU cache hits & misses 
- Slab allocation which made sense after Oz talked through it. 

Going to spend some time this AM wrapping up ex-7-6 and K&R Ch 8, and then if time find some YouTube videos on stack and heap memory.
