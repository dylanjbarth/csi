Going to start taking daily notes just so I have a dumping ground for thoughts as I'm moving through the program. Found the sync up last night really motivating mostly due to how many moments I found myself scratching my head.. 

- not knowing off the top of my head how much memory is allocated by the compiler when a simple data type is declared
- stack and heap memory, stack frames..
- dangling pointers
- CPU cache hits & misses 
- Slab allocation which made sense after Oz talked through it. 

Going to spend some time this AM wrapping up ex-7-6 and K&R Ch 8, and then if time find some YouTube videos on stack and heap memory. 

Nice tutorial on lldb - interactive debugger for C for Mac (gdb on Linux) https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2017/winter/15200-2/assigns/week5/lldb.html. Run program with lldb, `run`, `continue`, `quit`, `n` to step over, etc. Similar to node or python debuggers (probably the basis for them actually..) Output is unbelievably more helpful. 

Before: 
```bash
$ cc ex-7-6.c && ./a.out lorem.txt lorem.txt
Segmentation fault: 11
```
After: 

```bash
$ cc -g ex-7-6.c && lldb ./a.out lorem.txt lorem.txt
(lldb) target create "./a.out"
Current executable set to '/Users/dylanbarth/projects/csi/preparation-phase/c-lang/book-exercises/a.out' (x86_64).
(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args  "lorem.txt" "lorem.txt"
(lldb) run
Process 86675 launched: '/Users/dylanbarth/projects/csi/preparation-phase/c-lang/book-exercises/a.out' (x86_64)
Process 86675 stopped

Back trace command `bt` will show you the actual stack frames 
```bash
(lldb) bt

    frame #3: 0x00007fff6c266cc9 libdyld.dylib`start + 1
```

Random Question for next sync
- in C why are some typedefs capitalized vs all caps? eg DIR vs Dirent vs point.  

PM: going to get started on the ls clone, the exercises for end of 8 seem like good ones to circle back on to understand how malloc is working under the head better, but I want to have some fun and start building ls.
