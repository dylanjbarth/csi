Fleshing out the ls-clone program and started running into some really weird errors. 

Decided to document it in the commit message to be able to reference the clean diff. Check out commit 35256c228f1ecf7933e17ee95b3edb5bc12fd701. An example of how cryptic C can be with it's error messages AND how you could have bugs sitting in your code that compiles just fine but could be triggered by one small additional modification. Would be worth reviewing this with peers / in class to understand a bit better. I wonder if the C compiler can be tuned to warn for stuff like this, like make it stricter?

Haha, man I am making some stupid mistakes this morning! 

Check this out 

```
int  idx, longest  =  0;
```
Yeah that does not set idx to zero, but it does give it a random value I assume in the memory space. 

```
Adding ./. to entries at 32766
```

I was seeing that. Just needed to initalize idx properly.
```
int  idx  =  0, longest  =  0;
```
Just when I think I'm starting to get C, back to the basics.

Also omg I feel like I making this so complicated implementing different sorting strategies. I feel like I'm trying to bang out some python in C. Kind of. I just can't help it.
