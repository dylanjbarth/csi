I may have found a small inconsistency with the actual ls program (but it could be a known caveat that is documented in the man page.)

When I run `ls -C . > test.txt` it actually streams the data in columnar output. However if I provide a different directory (something other than current?) it seems to switch to `-1` format. 

Spend some time pulling my hair out today fixing a bug with my actual sorting/insertion logic, but this is why we test!

Added some tests that basically just run the clone and ls side by side and then run diff tool (which conveniently exits with 1 if there is a diff).
