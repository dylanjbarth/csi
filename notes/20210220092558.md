Going through go exercises and asked to implement a bitdiff function, realizing I can't hide from bitshifting anymore so trying to grok it.

What is a number base?

The base to the power of the place number (eg ones, tens, hundreds) => the addition of all of these is the number total. 

If we want to express 13 in base 2: 

How many 13s are in 16?
0
_  _ _ _ _ 
16 8 4 2 1

How many 8s are in 13? 

0  1
_  _ _ _ _ 
16 8 4 2 1

Now we have 5 left. How many 4s are in 5?

0  1 1
_  _ _ _ _ 
16 8 4 2 1

Now we have 1 left, how many 2s are in 1? None. So we have 1 left. So 13 in binary is: 

0  1 1 0 1
_  _ _ _ _ 
16 8 4 2 1

Addition in binary is just addition in base 2, so instead of carrying the result in the tens place you carry the result any overflow from the 2s place. 

To do addition with bits, we can use bitshift operators &, ^, and << 

& is only true if both quantities are true. Thus the & operator shows us the positions that need a carry (because both values are 1). 

^ XOR (exclusive OR) - basically ONLY OR, so both cannot be true. If one is true and the other is false, XOR is true. This is basically is the opposite of the & operator. 

<< left shift operator moves each binary digit left by 1. A 0 is created in the blank space on the right. 

so to add in binary: find the carries with &, then do the addition with the ^, then we add the carries to the XOR'd result. 

3 + 1 in binary. 

a = 1, b = 3

a => 0001
b => 0011
& => 0001 (aka carry result and in the next step we bit shift to put it into the correct carry place)
^ => 0010
<< the & => 0010
we combine bitshifted carry with the XOR result using XOR => 
0010
0010
& => 0010
^ => 0000
<< => 0100 ^ 0000 => result is 4 or 0100

So you rinse and repeat until there is nothing left to carry. 

The other bitwise operators in golang are OR | and AND NOT &^

32 bits => 8 bytes => 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 and the largest unsigned number you can represent in binary with 32 bits is 4294967295 or 2^32 - 1.

ALSO totally separately, I started working on the xkcd comic index today and wrote the extractor, I wrote a really naive version that just iterates from 1 and goes until it hits a 404. I checked manually and saw there should be about 2.5k comics give or take, so I wrote a script that basically was like iterate until you hit a 404. Well guess what.

Tell me if that is not an easter egg and a half. I'm grinning ear to ear right now. Randall Munroe, clap clap. But also now dangit I need to fix my extractor to be smarter than this.
