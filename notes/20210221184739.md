Working on a small package to build my comic index and am using this as a chance to learn how to do step through debugging in VS Code with the Delve debug tool.

Separately running into an error running some tests 

$ go test index_test.go main.go
main.go:7:2: package gopl-exercises/ex-4-12/xkcd/extract is not in GOROOT (/usr/local/go/src/gopl-exercises/ex-4-12/xkcd/extract)
main.go:8:2: package gopl-exercises/ex-4-12/xkcd/types is not in GOROOT (/usr/local/go/src/gopl-exercises/ex-4-12/xkcd/types)

It doesn't like my imports of my other packages.

Honestly I don't think I've got this quite figured out yet, but I definitely broke things by upgrading to go 1.16. In the release notes I'm seeing that https://golang.org/doc/go1.16 

> Module-aware mode is enabled by default, regardless of whether a`go.mod`file is present in the current working directory or a parent directory. More precisely, the`GO111MODULE`environment variable now defaults to`on`. To switch to the previous behavior, set`GO111MODULE`to`auto`.

And I tested, if I flip that back to auto it works again. So i'm going to roll with that for now and try and understand this later when I'm not so tired.
