Bitwise operators 

- numbers are represented in a computer in binary - base2. 
- 5 is 0101
- << left shift = 1010 = add an extra power of 2, so you always are multiplying by 2. 
- >> right shift = 0010 = removing a power of 2, so you are dividing by 2. 
ways to combine 
- & and = return 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.  
- | or = return 1 if any bit is 1. 
- ^ exclusive or = return 1 if only 1 bit is 1.

Why use bitwise operators?

what is chmod 777 - octal values, rwx bits are on. Permissions as sequences of bits.
