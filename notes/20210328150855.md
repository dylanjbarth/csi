Questions for class as I'm going through the x86_64 tutorial:

- why would we actually want to reference the lowest 32 bits of a register unless there is a way to reference the highest 32 bits and actually use the space saved? (is there?)
- system calls in the rax register? Are those just purely conventions? In hex it seemed like a random decimal number. 
- are the registers reset when a function is called? eg rcx is that always 0 or should it always be set?
