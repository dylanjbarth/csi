Class 1 on assembly: 

why does this matter?
- embedded systems, writing highly optimized code because you know more about your data than the compiler does
- programmers are writing in c and c++ then inspecting the disassembly and trying to hint to the compiler what is desired, then dropping into assembly if needed. 
- assembly is the API to the CPU 

Why use specific registers?

- aside from interop with other code (eg expects register value to be populated by caller or caller saved (where you need to pop to and from stack to save it))

Why use 32 vs 64 bit register sizes?

- less space = performance 
- sometimes to keep the binary size down
- sometimes backward compat 

What is microcode?

Machine code isn't the lowest abstraction. It's the interface to the CPU, Intel doesn't publish it but they translate machine code into microcode. 

An OS can patch a CPU by running some instructions to execute microcode – flashing memory that stores the implementation of machine code instruction.

lea - memory access instruction that doesn't access memory – it's like move but gets the address and stores that in the register.
