If we have an array of integers and we are attempting to average them, what % of time is spent on compute?

If we break down a simple accumulation algorithm into assembly, inside the loop (in the critical path) we do a cmp, jg, mov, add, inc, so more or less 40% of our instructions are compute instructions, but if you think about the loop: all the instructions take a quarter of a ns, whereas the fetch from memory takes 100ns! so without caching, the massive majority of our time would be spent fetching things from memory. Processor memory gap!
 
Why do we have separate caches with different characteristics instead of having one big cache?

- further away means you can have more space but it's slower to access. It's a compromise because closer to register and ALU you are the more expensive and smaller you are but faster you can get to it. Furniture example: high-end furniture store wants to be on the best street possible, but it's really expensive and so you have a small showroom. Customers come in and want a specific piece which you have but it's in your warehouse a long way away. 

How much data is on 1 cache line? 64 bytes which means you can store 16 integers per cache line. Each integer is 32 bits. 64*8/32 = 16.

With a cache, each cache access takes 5ns.
