on the prework, is it possible to use a sync.Cond approach without using a sync.Mutex? sync.Cond requires a Locker interface.

– this got asked and was answered in slack:

In the mutex exercise, what does this part mean?  

> "Consider also using`sync.Cond`to improve upon a basic “spin-lock” approach."

I implemented a mutex with busywait, how do I use the[sync.Cond,](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Cond)  
having that it does want a mutex itself, and the code example for the Cond.Wait method uses`c.L.Lock()`before calling wait.  
My understanding is that at this point, when`Lock()`  succeeded, all the busy-waiting is already done. So looking for a hint for the right direction here. (edited)

Ah, good question. Sorry, I know it's a bit silly, but you can create a**separate**`sync.Mutex`just for use in the`sync.Cond`. (edited)

You might be wondering "how could you ever have a situation where you use a mutex as part of implementing a mutex, it seems circular", it'll be more clear on Tuesday.

But the main goal of that extra part is to get some practice using`sync.Cond`


Questions from reading through mutex.go

constants were confusing? 
mutexLocked =  1  <<  iota  // mutex is locked. 
iota is 0 so the left shift doesn't do anything?
