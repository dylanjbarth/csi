questions for gc class: 

CSAPP 9.10 reading: 

- mark and sweep algorithm - section 9.10.3
- how does isPtr actually work if there is no way for it to determine if it's a pointer or not?


Baby's GC 

- what are some other strategies used to trigger garbage collection (besides the simple example of a set number of alloctaions)

Ardan Labs

- heap is not a container… Think that any memory reserved for application use in the process space is available for heap memory allocation. – my understanding was that the stack and the heap "grow" toward each other, which feels linear. Is there a more accurate way to think about the heap? 


Ballast: 

- they were able to achieve a speedup by reducing the number of times the GC runs by creating an artificially large heap size at the start of the application. This _appears_ to be in conflict with the main takeaway from Ardan Labs post which was to reduce unnecessary allocations as much as possible. They were trying to hack the pace of the GC basically. 
- Who is right? I guess it depends on the application?
