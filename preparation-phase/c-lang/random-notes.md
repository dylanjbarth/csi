# Challenges 

- having to size arrays is hanging me up. Does that mean I just have to make decisions about what reasonable input sizes could be and handle scenarios that exceed those bounds?
- not having a great mental model for how computer memory works is making it a bit harder to grok how simple data types are stored and used. 
- Bitwise operations don't make sense yet. 
- So far not really grokking pointer arithmetic either 
- Need to get really clear on the pointers and dereferencing pointers, eg * and & syntax.
