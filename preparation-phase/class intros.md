Hi everyone, we’re still finalizing the cohort but I’ll be adding folk here as they accept their places, so that we can start to get to know one another and have a single place to ask questions etc. Welcome!

To encourage you all to post intros, I can start![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f642.png)My name is Oz, and I started Bradfield in 2015 after some formative experiences helping non-traditionally educated software engineers reach the same level of performance as those on my team who’d graduated from top schools. I’m a non-traditionally educated engineer myself, having ultimately majored in math due to a poor standard of CS education in the city where I grew up (Sydney, Australia). Immediately before Bradfield, I was co-founder and CTO of Vida Health ([vida.com](http://vida.com/)), and a startup called Topguest. I’ve also worked at a few startups in both IC and leadership roles. After a decade in San Francisco I recently moved back to Australia where I live on a rural property with my wife and daughter (another due in a few weeks!), a dog, a few goats, and a bunch of wildlife… very different to our lifestyle in SF, particularly with Bradfield HQ having been in SoMa![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f642.png)

Hi everyone, my name is Ryan. I have a bachelors in Applied Math and CS (though the CS part was heavily geared towards theory instead of practice). After undergrad, I worked at an options market making firm called Susquehanna International Group, then moved on to a crypto trading start up as a Senior Trader. (Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the field, though you might be disappointed by the answers since it's a very glorified industry.) I left after working there for two years and am now living in Washington with my partner and a new puppy! Looking forward to having a fun time learning with you all!Edited for grammar xD (edited)

Hello, all. My name is Rishi. My formal education was in statistics which included a couple of the intro CS courses but nothing more advanced. I came to software engineering a bit later into my career and have been working in the industry for a few years. A good chunk of my software development experience has come from the world of professional sports (baseball and soccer), though the last couple years I’ve been working at a tech company. I live in Chicago and and I’m really happy to be in this program with everyone!

Hey I’m Arlandis. My first job was at a software consultancy in Chicago. They had an apprenticeship program and that’s where I really leveled up, having spent time here and there trying to learn to program. Now I work remotely for a startup in SF (I’m in Michigan). I’ve always missed the incredible amount of learning that happened at that first job and that’s what led me here. I’m also married and have a new baby, so much of life outside of computers is spent with them.

Howdy everyone! I'm Kai. Like some other folks here, I also have a degree in math. I've spent my career as a data engineer for a few different startups, and currently lead the Data Engineering & Personalizations teams at Skillshare. As a data engineer I spend a lot of time with things like databases and container orchestrators, and have always wanted to learn more about how all that cool infrastructure works under the hood, which is why I'm so excited to be here with y'all! Right now I live in Brooklyn but am moving to Guadalajara, Mexico this summer to live with my girlfriend.

Hi there. My name is Alex. I have bachelors in Computer Science. I started my career working as sysadmin, later transitioned into SRE. I worked at Mirantis(one of the companies contributed to OpenStack), Facebook, and now work at Jane Street(proprietary trading firm in New York). At the moment I am located in Ventura, CA, but soon I am moving back to Russia after 4.5 years in the USA. I live with my wife and daughter. When I took Bradfield's OS course in June 2020, I realized that it is very hard to dedicate enough time to family, work, and studying at the same time, so I am leaving my current job so I can focus on the CSI.

Hi everybody, I'm thrilled to joining this community! My quick bio: I have a bachelors in Cognitive Science. I received some exposure to programming as a part of my classes in undergrad but started coding in earnest in my first job out of school as a co-founder of an ed-tech startup called Learning Equality where I was part-time engineer, part-time fundraiser for a couple of years. After that, I got a job with a startup in London as a data engineer, building out ETL pipelines and data sets for machine learning engineers. In 2016, I moved back to Texas and contracted for a year or so before joining the startup I currently work for as an early employee (it's called Liongard). I currently live in Houston with my wife and our two cats.

Hey y'all, I'm Kaijie (like Kai above ^ + "G"). I studied biology and math/stats in undergrad with a sprinkle of intro CS courses. I conducted CRISPR research for a year and a half before making the switch to software through Hack Reactor. After working at Uber for a few years and some consulting work, I recently joined Benchling to develop software for scientists. I like learning about the how and why of things, but I'm terrible at dedicating large chunks of time to it in a structured and constructive manner. Bradfield helped me stay on track with that when I took databases last summer and architecture right now. I'm not satisfied with the level and simplicity of the mental abstractions that I operate with now, so I'm looking forward to building my understanding from the "ground" up. Currently living in Maryland but will slowly make my way through the US back to SF soon. (edited)

Hi everyone. I’m Yusef, and I live in Switzerland![:sweat_smile:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f605.png).  
I have a bachelor in Telecommunication Engineer. During my studies, I was exposed to programming through very theoretical C++ and Java classes, so theoretical that programming exercises were handwriting![:sweat_smile:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f605.png), and I was not too fond of it. It was years later when I started playing around with Web development when I found the connection.  
Since then, I’ve been working mainly as a front-end engineer for small companies like agencies and big corporations like my current job, where we are trying to build an insurance platform to rule them all.  
I’m planning to keep my job during CSI, but last year I gathered enough holidays to make use of them during the most loaded phases of the program.  
I also teach web technologies in a Bootcamp here in Zürich, mainly JavaScript and front-end frameworks.

Hi everyone, my name is Olamide. I currently live in Vienna where I am completing my PhD in Computer Science (with a focus on IT Security). I studied CS at bachelors and masters level, it was mostly theoretical. After masters, I worked as a web designer but it wasn't challenging enough so I applied and got a PhD in 2017. Since I started my PhD in 2017, I felt I needed to revisit the basics of CS because of my background.  So I taught myself on the job. Now that I am finishing my PhD and transitioning to the industry as an infrastructure engineer (at Dedalus), I realised that a structured mode of study would help me better than doing this all alone. This realisation led me to Bradfield Teach yourself CS and that in turn led me to the CSI. I am single and I live with a couple of friends. Looking forward to a fun time learning with you all![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f642.png)

Hi everyone![:wave::skin-tone-2:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f44b-1f3fb.png)I’m Julius and I’ve worked as a software engineer at DigitalOcean in NYC since 2019 where I work on microservices using Go. Like many of you, I also don’t have a formal education CS and have come to CSI to gain a solid CS foundation. I have a bachelor’s degree in Physics and intended to go to graduate school for research, but after some research experience realized that it wasn’t for me. After college, I joined a healthcare software startup called CareCloud and worked as a client manager where I got to improve my interpersonal skills, but found that I really missed doing technical work.After exploring programming as a career change, I completed an online bootcamp that didn’t actually prepare me very well for working as a software engineer. I ended up studying for ~2 years at an online program called Launch School which was excellent and helped me land my current job at DigitalOcean. I’ve taken a few Bradfield courses before and loved them, but still wanted a more structured and comprehensive curriculum to learn CS fundamentals and help me grow my career. I’m looking forward to getting to know you all and learning together!

Hi everyone! I’m Natalie, I currently work in Web Development at a career services startup which has been recently acquired by a Private Equity Firm. I’m also mentoring a few students at Thinkful - a Web Dev bootcamp.   
I got my bachelors in Math and Mathematical Methods in Economics in Belarus, where I’m from originally. I don’t have any formal CS education. All the knowledge I have had been accumulated over the years as I was working at different companies varying from Outsourcing to Startups, plus self-directed learning. I want to actually understand what’s going on under the hood and ultimately be able to create innovative and fresh solutions vs merely reusing what others had built.  
I’m based in Jersey City, NJ for the time being.  
Very excited to get started and learn with/from all of you!

Hi all! I’m Paul. I’ve been working as a programmer since 2014, when I transitioned from Mechanical Engineering. I am self-taught, but didn’t know any of the lower-level Computer Science concepts. I first learned of Bradfield through[teachyourselfcs.com](http://teachyourselfcs.com/)and then spent most of 2020 completing Bradfield’s Core CS program, which was awesome.I’m looking forward to continuing to learn the fundamentals through this program and become a better engineer. I currently work at Pluralsight, which is an online education company, but would love to start something on my own using the skills I’ve learned at Bradfield.I’m originally from Columbus, Ohio, and have lived and worked in London, Chicago and Boston, before moving away from the city and working remotely near St. Augustine, Florida, which is on the Atlantic side of the state.Really excited to start learning and working with everyone!

Post software immersive programs, I've worked as a full-stack engineer, taught full-stack JavaScript as a corporate educator, and also as a front-end engineer. Currently I'm a full-stack engineer at a very small startup called Labviva.I loved my experiences at software immersive programs, as I grew so much by being surrounded by other people that are driven to learn and level themselves up, so the CSI program is perfect for my learning goals and objectives![:smile:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f604.png)I'm really excited to be here and look forward to working with all of you soon!

Hi everyone. I'm Andrew. I was a business finance major in undergrad, but I felt it didn't fit me very well and tried to do anything tech related after. I ended up muddling around in the back office of an insurance company (dreadfully boring stuff) before leveraging a bootcamp to land a web development job.I think I was attracted most by how great an impact tech and computing has changed people's lives, and I thought it would be really cool to be a part of that change. I think like everyone else, I'm really excited to dive deep into the fundamentals  
and hope it opens up my eyes to how things really work under the hood, and how to use those ideas  
to solve new challenges and the problems of tomorrow.Currently, I'm working with a small company called Seabury Solutions in Summit, NJ which specializes in creating  
software in the airline industry. I bounce around between some front end dev with javascript and c# to pl/sql programming for a lot of ETL type processes. Not all that interesting to be frank, especially compared to what everyone else mentioned, but it pays the bills for now haha![:sweat_smile:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f605.png)Also like everyone, I've often done some self-directed learning (a few things through teachyourselfcs), but in the end I think it's much more exciting, fun, and effective to learn alongside others. So definitely looking forward to  
meeting and learning with everyone.

Hi everyone! This is Meera, from Bangalore, India. Very excited to meet you all and be a part of the program.A bit about myself - I have a CS degree, which I realized was pretty weak when I started and struggled with a Master's program at U of Illinois. I switched gears and graduated with an Information Systems degree instead.I worked with a few startups and also as an indie web & ios developer while pursuing a parallel gig in Indian Music. My most recent work has been at Hasura, as a Solutions engineer, which I have now quit to study full-time. I look forward to learning CS at a deep level here at Bradfield. On the side, I also plan to volunteer with local FOSS communities.My dream is to do interesting work where software intersects with art, and the physical world. And, to also learn Haskell someday. (edited)

Hey! I live in the Bay Area and work as an engineer at Uber. I have a “non-traditional” SWE background having majored in Mechanical Engineering, and initially worked in analytics and data science (also at Uber) before transitioning to engineering just over two years ago. Although I took some CS classes in college, most of my programming education has been either on the job or through MOOCs (Coursera, Udacity, etc.) and books, so I’m very excited to follow a more structured curriculum in a class of fewer than 10,000 students ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f642.png)A tiny bit about my non-work self: I’m Canadian and grew up in the “snowbelt” just outside of Toronto. True to the stereotype, I played hockey most of my life but since moving to the Bay I’ve “hung up” the skates and now spend most of my leisure time in the mountains or trying, largely unsuccessfully, to surf.Looking forward to getting to know all of you! (edited)

>  Importantly, please note that we have had to schedule classes on Tuesday and Friday evenings, rather than Monday and Thursday as was indicated on the CSI website. Class time is 5pm-6:30pm PT. Please let me know as soon as possible if this is going to be a serious problem for you and we will try to figure something else out.

This shouldn’t be too big an issue for me. It will mean I’ll have to miss at least two Friday lectures this spring due to some already planned travel, but I can probably plan around it for any other travel the rest of the year. Friday night isn’t the most convenient time for class![:sweat_smile:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f605.png)but after reading through everybody’s intros above, I’m realizing how spread out we all are and I’m much more inclined to be flexible with timing so that it works for everybody. Also I have no social life anyway thanks to the pandemic, so who am I kidding![:grin:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f601.png)I’m curious — how is everybody planning on dealing with the timezone changes to make class and check ins? For me in the central timezone classes will be from 7-8:30pm.

Hey Everyone! Late to the party here but excited to learn with you all over the next year. I currently live in Sacramento, CA and work for a small software company called Flywheel Technologies. I studied public policy/econ in college so don’t have a formal CS background but took a few Bradfield classes this past year and enjoyed them a bunch and am excited to be in this more long form class. Outside of work/study, I ride my road/mtn bikes and play way too much pickleball. Look forward to e-meeting all of you soon!

Hi All! I’m Vamsi. I was a math major in college but ended up in a data engineering job at Allstate afterward and learned most of my skills on the job. I now work at Bittorrent as a DE working on etl processes, airflow, redshift working with engineering teams to implement best practices to send data and figuring out the needs of data scientists. Mostly working with python, mapreduce, pyspark and SQL.I took the database class here last here and realized I needed to have a better understanding of the underlying components of the tools I use. I decided to start the CSI program to gain knowledge in order to work on distributed systems roles (building a database, working on big data tools like pyspark) where I can build tools that are used in big data analytics.I was working in San Fransisco till last March, then moved back home and have been working remote from Edison, NJ. I’m excited to start learning with you all!
